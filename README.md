## ATMega32u4 HID Keyboard

### Board Project 2019 - Krishna Mani

This is software for ATMega32u4 or compatible AVR hardware USB chips that
implements a standard-complying HID keyboard using only AVR-LIBC.

### Hardware

##### Microcontroller

The ATMega32u4 controls the scanning matrix and the USB interface. I chose it
because of its hardware USB interface and because it has enough I/O pins to
support the whole keyboard without needing any multiplexing. It also has enough
flash and SRAM for storing layouts. The 32u4 on the keyboard runs at 16mHz from
an external crystal oscillator with 22pF load capacitors. It is powered directly
from the USB lines with filtering capacitors.

##### PCBs

Initially, I needed to test the main microcontroller circuit of the keyboard to
ensure that it worked and that the USB worked, because I had developed on an
Arduino Leonardo. (boards/ATMegaTestingBoard.brd)

##### ATMega32u4 Circuit

The portion of the board for the ATMega32u4 is fairly standard for this chip and
is similar to the Arduino Leonardo, excluding the power regulators. It consists
of the chip, the oscillator and load caps, the power and layer leds, the reset
switch, the USB connector and data resistors, the ICSP pins, and the filtering
    caps on the underside of the board.

The rest of the board is the scanning matrix. The rows and columns use up the
majority of the I/O on the chip.  The matrix is standard for a keyboard - one
pin of each switch in a column is connected through a diode to every other one
in the column. Then, the remaining pin in each switch is common with the row. I
used through hole diodes because they are much easier to solder. The switches
are standard mechanical keyboard switches, and the footprints are from here:
https://github.com/mknyszek/gateron-eagle To read the matrix, the row pins are
pulled high through internal pull-up resistors. One column at a time is set low,
so that a pressed key would pull the row pin low, signaling a key press at the
current row and column index.

##### Board Assembly

Assembling the board was straightforward except for the SMD components,
specifically the TQFP ATMega32u4. It is really easy to bridge several pads very
quickly, and completely ruin the chip. I soldered these by holding them in place
and tacking down the corners so the chip didn’t move. I used a lot of flux, then
with very little solder dragged the iron across the pins. The USB connector is
also really difficult, I soldered the anchor pins and then the pins. It is
really easy to bridge the pins with the ground enclosure. Using super glue after
ensures that the connector doesn’t snap off when you unplug the cable.

### Code

To compile you need ``cmake``

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/cmake-avr/generic-gcc-avr.cmake ..
$ make
```

##### USB

First, the USB controller of the 32u4 is initialized. This is handled in the
function `usb_init()`. The PLL (Phase Locked Loop) is initialized, taking the
external clock as input. It runs at 48mHz and acts as the USB clock. After the
USB controller is initialized, the control endpoint is set up and will receive
setup packets from the host. The setup packets, handled in the ISR
`USB_gen_vect`, elicit responses from the keyboard based on the values of
bmRequestType and bRequest, which determine the type of request. After the host
has requested and received the USB descriptors, and the keyboard has correctly
responded to HID-specific requests, the host can enumerate the device and use it
as an input device.

The key repeat feature of modern keyboards is handled separately from the
standard functions `usb_send()` and `usb_send_keypress()`. If a key is held down
for some period of time, it should be repeated until it is released. This is
    taken care of in the ISR `USB_gen_vect`, specifically when the SOFE (start
    of frame) bit is set. This interrupt triggers at 1kHz, which is how often
    the host sends start of frame packets. If no keypresses have been generated
    since the period time, which is kept track of with keyboard_idle_value and
    current_idle, the entire HID report is resent to facilitate key repeat. The
    period of time the device should wait before resending the report is set
    from the wValue in the HID request SET_IDLE.

##### Matrix Software

The scanning matrix of the keyboard uses the current sourcing and internal
pullups of the I/O ports on the 32u4. Because of the orientation of the diodes,
the columns of the keyboard are set low when they are going to be read. The rows
are always pulled up, meaning that if a key is pressed, it will be pulled low
because the switch is connecting the row and columns. The matrix scanning is
repeated quickly, and changes in key state are recorded in the six-byte USB HID
report. The report is six bytes to support six concurrent key presses. The
keyboard dynamically assigns and removes keys from the report to support
6-key-rollover, and it also resets the reports on layout layer shifts to prevent
strange glitches. The meta and special keys like CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT have their
own byte apart from the report, where each bit represents a different key. This
is according to the USB HID Spec.

The rows and columns of the recorded keypresses are translated into actual
keycodes from the specified layout in `layout.h`. The layout is written from the
standard HID keycodes in `keys.h`. Because the keyboard does not have enough
physical keys to support all the letters, function, and number keys, some keys
are macros that change the mappings of all the keys. These keys are handled
separately and do not generate keypress events on their own. Rather, they update
the current layer that the scanning matrix is reporting keypresses from to
change the keycodes.

### Improvements

1. Changing the routing on PORTD to make it iterable, making the code more readable and cleaner.
2. Using USB-C instead of micro b, meaning that you would not need a dongle for use with newer macs. This would, however, make it much more difficult to solder and the PCB more complicated, since the USB-C connectors have 24 pins.
3. Using the BGA package for the ATMega32u4 so that it could fit in between switches on the underside of the board, meaning that the PCB would only have to be as big as to fit the switches. This would make it more compact.
4. Using symmetrical keycaps so that the keycaps aren’t skewed when using keyboard layouts other than QWERTY.
5. Adding support for a dedicated FN key endpoint and Caps lock and num lock; currently you have to remap function to media keys with a third party tool for the media keys on the keyboard to work on touch bar macs.
6. Move the ICSP connector down, right now you have to bend the power LED up for the connector to make contact with the headers.
7. Route the third layer led to a different I/O port, right now only two of the three LEDs work.
